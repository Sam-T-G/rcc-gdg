# Docs index

Everything under `docs/` is evergreen: it should still be true next semester without edits. Anything tied to a date, a person, or a dollar figure for one term lives under [`semesters/`](../semesters/README.md). If a doc here needs a dated example, it links into a semester folder instead of carrying the date itself.

Read [01-governance/maintenance-rules.md](01-governance/maintenance-rules.md) before changing anything in this tree.
